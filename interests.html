         <h3>Whiskey</h3>
         <p>Scotch, Irish, American, American Single Malt, Bourbon. All favorites, Scotch and American Single Malt more favorite.
          I will unapologetically give you my opinion on whiskey, just ask.</p>

         <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
         <p>I might not be a great climber but it's my favorite form of physical activity. Specifically I boulder (A form of 
           rock climbing that doesn't use a rope while only climbing about 12 feet.)

         <h3>Traveling</h3>
         <p>When finishing college I had the opportunity , do to some internship funds, to 
           graduate early and travel the country. My favorite places in the US are 
           (in order)-> Yosemite Valley CA, Boundary Waters MN, Yellow Stone/Grand Teton WY, 
           Woodstock VT, the entire Pacific Coast, most of Colorado, Southern Canyons of Utah.

         <h3>Golf </h3>
         <p>When I was 15 years old I decided to pick up the game of golf. Why? I don't actually remember. But it has been a pain
           in my side for the last 8 years!

         <h3>Lisp</h3>
         <p>Honestly, I don't understand lisp. Why it's so loved by its users? Why does no one use it? And what the hell
           is a Macro and why it's the most powerful tool for a programmer? I am quite interested in trying to harness the 
           legendary power of lisp.

         <h3>Games</h3>
          <p> I grew up playing games, video, board, cards just name it. Being the youngest of the family, 
            (including extended family) there wasn't much I could compete at except for games. Games rely
            on objective thinking, creativity and sometimes persuasion, all things that a young kid can have.  </p>
