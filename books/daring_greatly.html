            <main> <h3> Daring Greatly</h3> <h6>By: NAME </h6><h6>August 2021</h6>
<p> 
    “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out
     how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could
     have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is
     actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat
     and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again
     and again... who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
     achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while 
     daring greatly.”― Teddy Roosevelt  <br>
