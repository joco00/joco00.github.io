                    <p>Qoutes that I'm thinking about</p>
<br><br>
<p>“Most geniuses—especially those who lead
 others—prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by
  exploiting unrecognized simplicities.” ― Andy Benoit</p>
<br><br> 

<ul>
    <li> “We but mirror the world. All the tendencies present in the outer world 
        are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, 
        the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own 
        nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is 
        the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our 
        happiness. We need not wait to see what others do.”― Mahatma Gandhi
    </li><br>

    <li> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points 
          out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of
          deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the
          man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by 
          dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, 
          who comes short again and again... who at the best knows in 
          the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, 
          if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” ― Teddy Roosevelt
