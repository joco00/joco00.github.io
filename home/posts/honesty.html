                    <h3> Honesty </h3> <h6>September 2021</h6>
<p>
     <i>**this is an unfinished post**</i><br>
     <p> This post is about intellectual honesty. <br>
        Its as simple as this -> <br>
        If we don’t know something it's our obligation to acknowledge that we don't know it. 
        What stands in our way of doing this? Is it ignorance causing us to believe that we 
        do understand the topic when actually we don't? Is it pride causing us to ignore the 
        fact we don't understand the topic when we should? Is it shame causing us to hide the 
        fact from others that we don’t understand the topic? Is it a mixture of all three?
        <br>-note : example of when we might do these.<br>
           - note: lazyness?<br>
           - note: anxiety?<br><br>

        When we are intellectually honest there are great (and easy!!) opportunities for growth. 
        A great opportunity could be being honest about an unwanted habit such as staying up too 
        late. If I could be honest about the facts that I stay up too late, don’t know why I do, 
        and that I know it's unhealthy, then I can start laying the foundation for growth. I 
        currently have no idea why I stay up so late, but that doesn’t stop me from learning 
        techniques on how to stop it. An easy example is when someone is talking to you and 
        you don’t understand what they might have said. Instead of letting them continue with 
        the belief that you understand them, let's be honest and say “I do not understand you. 
        Can you explain that to me again?” This will be beneficial for both you and the person 
        you’re discussing with since you will be forced into a sort of mutual understanding. <br><br>

        ELI5:<br>
        Ask when you don’t know. You only stand to gain something.
