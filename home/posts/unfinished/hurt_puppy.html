<h3> Hurt Puppy </h3> <h6>September 2021</h6>
<p>  <i>**this is an unfinished post**</i><br>
<p>My relationship with a hurt puppy</p>

<p> My experience with a hurt dog.<br><br>
What do we picture when we think of a hurt dog? I see the Sarah McLaughlin commercials with the song 
“will you remember me!!” bringing tears to our eyes as videos of dogs, cowering in ditches covered in 
fleas, baked in dirt, play one after the other in the attempt to get you to donate money. In most 
situations, those dogs have been neglected, abused and mistreated by society. They are scared and 
they have the right to be scared. <br><br>

If you were to approach a hurt dog it will try to protect itself in one of two ways. One, by cowering, 
hoping that you will not try and hurt it. Two, by attacking. It will growl and bite, not letting anyone
 close. Let's be honest, it has a good reason too! The dog has been abused by those it should have been 
 able to trust and now it needs to protect itself.<br><br>

What do we do with this dog? Do we ignore it like everyone else? That would be an easy option, everybody 
stays the same, nobody gets hurt, but if you want to care for the dog then you can’t ignore it. Ok then 
the next option could be the opposite, take the dog in and treat it like you would any other dog. Well 
this won't work either. The dog doesn’t trust you, it can’t go from being abused to sitting on your lap 
enjoying pets. More likely the dog is going to bite your hand if you try to pet it. The only approach to 
care for this dog that's going to work is to slowly build trust over time. <br><br>

In my relationship with a hurt dog I was bitten 5 times. Each time I was bitten I had to remember that 
the dog doesn’t want to hurt me, it’s trying to protect itself. Sounds so stupid that the dog is trying 
to protect its self from someone that is trying to care for it! The dog doesn’t see it that way. To the 
dog, it has no choice but to protect itself after what it's been through.<br><br>


I was bitten 5 times, on the 6th I bit back. Was this a good thing for me to do? No, it was a horrible 
thing for me to do. Why is it a bad thing to defend myself?
One, that dog will now never trust me. I lost that dog forever. Is it fair that the dog can bite me 5 
times without me biting back? No it isn’t fair if you're an equal to the dog, but you can't be an equal,
you need to step up and assume the responsiblity. This is what's hard about 
having a hurt dog, the relationship will never be fair. But thats what I signed myself up for. I said I’m not going to bite 
this dog, no matter how hard or how many times it bites me, I AM NOT GOING TO BITE BACK. And I failed. 
I bit back once. Why did I do it? Because I too am like a hurt dog. I have been hurt, and neglected and 
when i get to my limit i still bite when i know i shouldn't.
