<h3> Relationships (lessons learned) </h3> <h6>September 2021</h6>
<p>  <i>**this is an on going account of lessons learned about Relationships**</i><br><br>

    A relationship <b>needs</b> trust from the start. Trust in a way is like an investment, you need to put
    in some trust that you are willing to risk losing. But if its a good investment the trust and relationship
    will grow. When things get rocky, you will lose some trust but hopfully the balance is still positive and 
    can withstand the hit.<br>
    I had a relationship this year were the other person invested zero trust into the relationship. 
    When things got rocky the investment failed, instantly. she was willing to risk nothing so she 
    got nothing in return. I know I know, no risk no reward, but its TRUE!
    She lost out on someone who was willing to risk building that trust and the relationship.<br>
    Lesson learned: <b>both</b> sides need to risk trust to build a relationship. 
    <br><br>

    At times you will hurt eachother. It's inevitable. There needs to be structures in place before hand
    with ways to deal with it. Problems need to be addressed in a respectful constructive manner.<br>
    Example: From the book "Daring Greatly" the author talks about a relationship (romantic/friendship)
    is like a jar of marbles. If the person shows you trust or does something good, add marbles. If the 
    person acts in the opposite manner, take away marbles. As the jar fills or emptys change your relationship
    accordingly. At times smashing the jar might seem like a good idea, buts its not. The person smashing the 
    jar is hurt (they wouldnt smash the jar if they weren't) and the person whos jar that is is going to be hurt
    since their jar just got smashed. When a jar is empty, think about removing the jar. <br>
    I had a relationship this year were the other person smashed the jar when I acted poorly instead of removing
    some marbles. (Actually she never put marbles in her jar, look to the point about trust above)
