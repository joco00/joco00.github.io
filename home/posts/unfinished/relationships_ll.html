<h3> Relationships (lessons learned) </h3> <h6>September 2021</h6>
<p>  <i>**this is an on going account of lessons learned about Relationships**</i><br><br>

    A relationship <b>needs</b> trust from the start. Trust in a way is like an investment, you need to put
    in a some trust that you are willing to risk losing. But if its a good investment the trust and relationship
    will grow. When things get rocky, you will lose some trust but hopfully the balance is still positive and 
    can withstand the hit.<br>
    I had a relationship this year were the other person invested zero trust into the relationship. 
    When things got rocky the investment failed. she was willing to risk nothing so she 
    got nothing in return. I know I know, no risk no return but its TRUE!
    She lost out on someone who was willing to risk building that trust and the relationship.<br>
    Lesson learned: both sides need to risk trust to build a relationship.
