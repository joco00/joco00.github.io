                    <h3> First Post</h3> <h6>August 2021</h6>
<p>As the title describes, this is my first post, woot woot! For the last 3 years I've meant to
get a site put together but ultimately ran into road blocks. For now I'm using a github page as
a free platform to host a static site (Basically I have zero excuses not to at least have a free
static site). Recently I came to the conclusion that it's better to have something than to have nothing
at all. So this is that something. Its easier to improve overtime than it is to start from scratch. Yet again,
<a href="http://paulgraham.com" class="color"> Paul Graham</a> hasn't changed his site for basically 20 years and it's fine.
