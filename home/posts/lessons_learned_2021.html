<h3> Lessons learned 2021 </h3> <h6>September 2021</h6>
<p>  <i>**this is an ongoing post**</i><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Its the moments where you have no control over and that seem miserable at the 
            time that can end up being the most memorable. When I was in Joshua Tree I was camped out
            2 miles into the desert. At night the tempuratue drop from 70 to 30 at night with the addition
            of 40 mph winds. I thought I was going to freeze to death, but I didn't!! I wrote a journal
            entry after i got back to my car and I cry laughing everytime I read it.<br>
            Lesson learned: These moments can be the most memorable and funny to look back on.
        </li><br>
        <li>Karma. Good things happen to us when we give good back
            to the world. The key is being observant and recongnizing when the good and bad 
            happen. Again, the key is being observant. We need to recongnizing both good and bad. So often
            good is overlooked.
        </li><br>
        <li>The view is only as beautiful as the journey.<br>
            Climbing a mountain is hard. The view is breathtaking
            at the top, not only from its beauty but from the work you put in getting there. At the top no one 
            is talking, no one is complaining about the bugs, no is doing anything. The top of mountains are still.
            The people who climb mountains understand this. I went on a hike to the top of a mountain in the Adirondacks
            with my girlfriend at the time. A mile in she had it. We turned around and drove to the top of a different mountain,
            payed $40 bucks to get in and had a horrible time. People were complaining about the short hike to the top that
            was rocky and didnt have stairs, people were complaining about bugs, people took photos and left. No one 
            sat down and simply enjoyed what was infront of them. <br>
            This probably applys to more than an actual view and the journey to get there. You could probably make
            this a metaphor about life. Im not going to do that (just yet). Im simply saying that if you had to climb a 
            mountain to get a view, youre more likely to enjoy that view than someone who didn't.

        <li>Being alone in nature is not loney. Finding company in the world around you is an amazing feeling</li>
