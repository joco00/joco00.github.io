                <h3> Simplicity </h3> <h6>September 2021</h6>
<p>  <i>**this is an unfinished post**</i><br>

    My brother says simple isn't easy. Paul Graham has <a href="http://paulgraham.com/simply.html">written</a> about the importance of 
    Simplicity. (There are definitly more examples of people talking about simplicity) 
    There is a quote (i cant find who said it) If you cant say it simply do you understand it?
    In software you see this idea all the time, confusion is abstracted out into a simpler language or interface.
    0/1's -> machine code -> assembly code -> itermidiary code -> high level code 
    The bottom (left) if very complex, the top (right) is also very complex. But if you were trying to do the 
    right with the left it would be impossible. 

    Simplicity =/= Easy
