                <h3>Welcome to my site! </h3>
     <p>I'm Jake OConnor. To my friends I'm OConnor, To strangers I'm Markus. <br>
        I'm from Cleveland Ohio.<br>
        I went to The Ohio State University.<br>
        Got a BE in Computer Science and Engineering. <br>
        I have a bunch of <a href="https://joco00.github.io/interests" style='color: aqua;'> interests</a>
        and I love to talk about them.
        <br><br>

        The purpose of this site is to share some ideas in longer essay format, create lists that I 
        can easily share with people (ie books tab) as well as general practice writing a web page.
